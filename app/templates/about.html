        <h4>Music</h4>
        <p>
          I have been playing music for over 15 years now. I consider it to be my first true love.
          playing music for so long has awarded me so many experiences. I have been able to collaborate
          with other musicians, who have made me a better player myself.

        <h4>Chess</h4>
        <p>
          My Dad was the one who first introducted me to chess when I was eight years old. Still to this day the
          game captures my attention. I love the simplisity wrapped in the complexity of the game. As I've grown as
          a chess player I have noticed that I am able to apply may of its pricples to my everyday life.

          <h4>Gardening</h4>
          <p>
            There is nothing like the feeling of planting a seed, watering it day after day, and watching it grow from
            humble beginings into a full fledge plant. Gardening is one of the wonderful things that reminds me that
            there is a difference in the things I can and cannot control. It teaches me time and time again that patience,
            and consistency yield the best results!
